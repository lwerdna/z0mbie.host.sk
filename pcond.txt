                           ----------------------

Here i'm trying to define conditions, when it is possible to change order
of some consecutive x86 instructions and instruction blocks,
i.e. swap them, but keep program working the same.

Imagine that we have "ADD EAX, EBX" which is followed by "MOV ECX, EDX",
and we know that both instructions are not the destination of some JMP, CALL,
or any other code/data/algorithmic reference.
In such a case they can be swapped with each other.

Now lets examine conditions under which such a trick can be performed
for some arbitrary consecutive instructions.

1. ONE instruction

  Let it consists of:
    operation code, source object set, destination object set.

  Object set is a bitset of properties, instruction deal with:
      common registers: EAX,ECX,EDX,EBX,ESI,EDI,ESP,EBP (8 bits)
    flags (1 bit)
    memory reference (1 bit)

  We will enclose sets into { } brackets,
  as such full set is {EAX,EBX,ECX,EDX,ESI,EDI,ESP,EBP,flags,memory}
  and empty set is {}.
  In binary notation it may look just like a 10-bit number.

  Memory reference means that at least any byte in memory can be read/written
  by our instruction.
  We dont distinguish memory addresses, because of the following:
  if there are two instructions,
  first one accessing memory at [eax],
  second one accessing memory at [ebx],
  and we dont know if eax/ebx are equal or not (or 4-byte ranges intersects);
  then, it is just a memory reference for us,
  and we only know that it could be the same variable.

  Other properties, such as EIP, segment-, FPU-, MMX-, SSE-registers,
  are not considered here, since limited application of our theory.
  We just assume, that no one instruction (except maybe NOP) can be mixed with
  INT, RET, CALL, JMP, JXX, or FPU/MMX instructions.

  "Source object set" is a set of objects to be read.

  "Destination object set" is a set of objects to be written/modified.

  Any destination object supersedes source object.
  I mean that in "ADD EAX, EBX" instruction, EBX is source object,
  and EAX is both source and destination object,
  but we say that EAX is destination object only,
  and we never say that EAX is source;
  however, we always keep in mind that any destination object
  can be also (indirectly) source object.
  But, if we have "ADD ECX, ECX" instruction, we MUST include 2nd (src) ECX
  into source object set.

  Lets consider some typical instructions:

  INSTRUCTION             DESTINATION OBJECT SET        SOURCE OBJECT SET

  nop                     <none>                        <none>
  mov R1, R2              R1                            R2
  cmp R1, R2              flags                         R1, R2
  add R1, R1              R1, flags                     R1
  adc R1, R2              R1, flags                     R2, flags
  mov R1, [R2+R3]         R1                            R2, R3, memory
  add R1, [R2+R3]         R1, flags                     R2, R3, memory
  sub [R1+R2], R3         flags, memory                 R1, R2, R3
  test [R1+R2], R3        flags                         R1, R2, R3, memory
  inc R1                  R1, flags                     <none>
  lea R1, [R2+R3]         R1                            R1, R2
  xchg R1, [R2]           R1, memory                    R2
  push R1                 ESP, memory                   R1
  pop R1                  ESP, R1                       memory
  cld                     flags                         <none>
  lods                    ESI, EAX                      flags, memory
  rep lods                ESI, EAX, ECX, flags          flags, memory
  stos                    EDI, memory                   EAX, flags
  rep stos                EDI, ECX, memory, flags       EAX, flags
  rep cmps                ESI, EDI, ECX, memory, flags  memory

2.1. TWO instructions

  let they look as

  CMD1 DST1, SRC1
  CMD2 DST2, SRC2

  where DST1, SRC1, DST2, SRC2 are source/destination object sets.
  Any of these sets could be empty.

  We also assume that both instructions are already filtered/checked,
  i.e. no one of them is JMP, CALL, RET, etc.

  So, we have 4 sets, and we have 6 relations between
  each 2 of these sets. {C(4,2) = 4!/2!*(4-2)! = 6}

2.2. Simple conditions

  Each of six relations is bitwise AND operation on the two bitsets, returning
  logical ZERO or NON-ZERO. In other words, each two sets can intersect or not.

  #define INTERSECT(bitset_X, bitset_Y)  ((bitset_X & bitset_Y) != 0)

  Here is 3 conditions, when it is possible to swap two instructions:

   (DST1 & DST2) == 0                                                [1]
   (DST1 & SRC2) == 0                                                [2]
   (DST2 & SRC1) == 0                                                [3]

  Other 3 (unused) relations looks as following:

   (DST1 & SRC1) == whatever                                         [4]
   (DST2 & SRC2) == whatever                                         [5]
   (SRC1 & SRC2) == whatever                                         [6]

  Example:

  add eax, ebx          # cmd1=ADD  dst1={EAX,flags}  src1={EBX}
  sub ebx, ecx          # cmd2=SUB  dst2={EBX,flags}  src2={ECX}
  [1] == FALSE      {EAX,flags} intersects {EBX,flags}
  [2] == TRUE       {EAX,flags} doesnt intersects {ECX}
  [3] == FALSE      {EBX,flags} intersects {EBX}

  as such, these two instructions can not be swapped.


2.3. Advanced conditions

  There exists some advanced conditions, which requires more analysis.
  In such a cases, some of [1], [2], [3] conditions can be ignored.

  For example:

   (CMD1 == CMD2) && (DST1 == DST2) && [2] && [3]                    [7]

  or

   #define GROUP_1(cmd)  ((cmd == ADD) || (cmd == SUB))
   GROUP_1(CMD1) && GROUP_2(CMD2) && (DST1 == DST2) && [2] && [3]    [8]

  For example (below), [1] is FALSE, but since [8], the following
  instructions can be swapped:

  add eax, ecx
  sub eax, edx

  Now, imagine, that we have the following commands:

  mov [ebp+4], eax
  mov [ebp+8], ecx

  Such a situation should be handled in a special way;
  otherwise our theory will grow to contain lists of variables in the
  object sets; also this will require checking for intersection
  of memory ranges & etc.

  Except that all, we can ignore condition [1], in cases when instructions
  are followed by code which doesn't uses DST1 and DST2 object sets.
  But this will require much more analysis, and i think it is not optimal.

3. From single instruction to block of instructions

  Imagine that we have these instructions (following each other):

  [a] add eax, ecx
  [b] adc eax, edx
  [c] add ebx, ecx
  [d] adc ebx, edx
  [e] sub esi, edi

  We can not swap [a] and [b], and we can not swap [c] and [d].
  But we can swap [ab] and [cd].

  As such, we need some entity to replace consecutive instructions with.

4. ONE block of N instructions

  CMD1 DST1, SRC1
  CMDi DSTi, SRCi
  CMDN DSTN, SRCN

  If we will consider this block as a single instruction,
  how to calculate summary SUM_DST and SUM_SRC object sets?
  I.e. sets of objects which are read and written by that code block.

  Simplest way is to do BITWISE OR for all SRC/DST[i]; it is correct,
  but then the we will lose some possibilities in the future,
  as shown in the following example:

   mov eax, ebx
   add eax, ecx
   adc edx, eax

  here, SUM_SRC, if calculated as SRC1|SRC2|SRC3, is equal to
  EBX|ECX|EAX, however it is not necessary to include EAX into that set,
  since it is initialized inside of this block, but not passed into.

  So, algorithm of calculating SUM_SRC and SUM_DST is the following:

  SUM_SRC = 0
  SUM_DST = 0
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++)           # in the example shown above (N=3):
  {                                #       i =    0      1          2
    SUM_SRC |= SRC[i] & (~SUM_DST) # SUM_SRC =  {EBX}  {EBX,ECX}  {EBX,ECX}
    SUM_DST |= DST[i]              # SUM_DST =  {EAX}  {EAX}      {EAX,EDX}
  }

5. TWO BLOCKS

  Working with blocks is the same as working with single instructions,
  except that SUM_SRC and SUM_DST should be calculated, as it were
  shown above.

  You can swap two blocks, or block and single instruction, it doesn't matter.

6. How to find out object sets for some given instruction?

  Probably, using something like ADE32 and some additional analysis.
